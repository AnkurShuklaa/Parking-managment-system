# Parking-managment-system

->I will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the parking lot:
->The parking lot have multiple slots. Slots are filled in FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve) order. 
->Customers can register for parking ticket by providing informations such as vehicle's registration number, owner's name, email ID, date of allocation, slot number etc.
->Once a slot has been occupied by a customer for a particular date, it won't be available for allocation by other customers for the same date. Only one vehicle can be parked in a particular slot on a date.
->Customers can view, edit and delete allocation.
-> Deleting a vehicle will deallocate the particular slot for that date.
->Search vehicles by registration number, owner's name, email ID, date of allocation, slot number etc.
